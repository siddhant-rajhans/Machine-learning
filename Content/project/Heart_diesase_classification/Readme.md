**Heart Disease Prediction App**
================================

This is a web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters. The app uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of patient characteristics and heart disease outcomes.

**How to Use the App**
------------------------

1. Enter your clinical parameters in the input fields.
2. Click the "Predict" button to get a prediction of heart disease likelihood.
3. The app will display the predicted outcome and the probability of heart disease.

**Input Parameters**
---------------------

The app requires the following input parameters:

* Age (years)
* Sex (male or female)
* Chest Pain Type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic)
* Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
* Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
* Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl (yes or no)
* Resting Electrocardiographic Results (nothing to note, ST-T wave abnormality, or possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
* Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (beats per minute)
* Exercise Induced Angina (yes or no)
* ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
* The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (upsloping, flatsloping, or downsloping)
* Number of Major Vessels Colored by Flourosopy (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)
* Thalium Stress Result (normal, fixed defect, or reversible defect)

**Model Performance**
---------------------

The machine learning model used in this app has been trained on a dataset of patient characteristics and heart disease outcomes. The model has been validated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Limitations**
--------------

This app is for educational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. The predictions made by the app are based on a machine learning model and may not reflect the actual likelihood of heart disease.

**Credits**
------------

This app was built using the following open-source libraries and resources:

* **Streamlit**: A Python library for building web applications
* **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python
* The dataset used to train the model is the **Heart Disease Classification Dataset**, which is a modified version of the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) and is also available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset).

I would like to extend my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of these libraries and resources for making them available to the community.
